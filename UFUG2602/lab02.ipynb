    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will develop a deeper understanding of **Asymptotic Complexity** through two programming exercises. We recommend that you ensure you have mastered **Python Basics** from the previous week and have a full understanding of the knowledge taught by Prof. Wang this week before starting the experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you decide to begin, it is crucial to read carefully and think logically before writing solution codes. **Reflecting on your thinking process and understanding** of the topic is more important than the final correct output results. And We encourage discussions, but Copying answers from other sources, including replacing variable names in existing answers and combining structures from different functions or methods, is strictly prohibited. It is important to note that any instances of plagiarism will have a direct impact on your final grade for this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About this Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we have included some explicit tests to help you verify the correctness of your code implementation. You must ensure that your test output can be viewed in the version of the file you submit, and that they should be re-verifiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Review what we learned in Python basics\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Intuitively understand the concept of time complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Know how to use recursion to implement a given algorithm, and understand how to utilize recursion in algorithm design for a real problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab requires the following packages:\n",
    "* matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often recommended to use command `pip install matplotlib` to install them.\n",
    "If you still have any problems installing your Python environment, please check the documentation [here](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/) or ask your teaching assistant for help during the Lab course."
