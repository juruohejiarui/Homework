    "## Idea and state definition\n",
    "The basic idea is that convert the problem into Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem. Let $A,B$ be the two string that we deal with. Then, let $p_c$ be the set of position (or index) of character $c$ in $B$. Then construct a sequence $C$ by the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the characters of $A$ from left to right. If character $c$ is not in $B$, then skip. Otherwise, add all the elements of set $p_c$ to the end of $C$ , from larger index to smaller index.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when $A=\"\\texttt{abdcc}\", B=\"\\texttt{bcaac}\"$, we get that :\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p_{\\texttt{a}}=\\{3,4\\}, p_{\\texttt{b}}=\\{1\\}, p_{\\texttt{c}}=\\{2,5\\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Then we can construct $C$: \n",
    "$$\n",
    "4,3,1,5,2,5,2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Then we can calculate the LIS of $C$, which is the position sequence of selected index of LCS of $A$ and $B$. In the previous example, one of LIS of $C$ is $1,2,5$, then the LCS of the original problem should be $\"\\texttt{bcc}\"$ .\n",
    "\n",
    "For state definition: Let $f(i)$ be the LIS of subsequence $C_{1\\dots i}$ when the last element should be $C_i$ .\n",
    "## State Transition Equation\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(i)=\\begin{cases}\n",
    "1 & \\text{if }C_i \\text{ is the minimum of } C_{1\\dots i} \\\\\n",
    "\\max_{1\\leq j< i, C_j<C_i}\\{f(j)\\} + 1 & \\mathrm{otherwise}\n",

    "## Time Complexity\n",
    "For a $C$ with length $l$, by applying RMQ (Range Minimum/Maximum Query) data structure, we can get a time complexity of $\\Theta(l\\log_2 l)$, what me need to do is that:\n",
    "- set up a data structure that can answer the maximum value of a contiguous subsequence (represented by a segment $[l,r]$) of a sequence with $\\Theta(n\\log_2 n)$ (called $\\mathrm{query}(l,r)$) and modify one position $p$ of that sequence to be $v$ (called $\\mathrm{modi}(p,v)$) with $\\Theta(n\\log_2 n)$ .\n",
    "- when we finish calculate $f(i)$, perform $\\mathrm{modi}(C_i,f(i))$ .\n",
    "- when we need to calculate $f(i)$ , perform $\\mathrm{query}(\\text{minimum of }C, C_i-1)$ .\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\Sigma$ be the size of character set of $A,B$, then the average value of $l$ is $O\\left(\\frac{mn}{\\Sigma}\\right)$ , and the best cases is $O(n)$ when the chracters in B are different from other.\n",
    "Thus the time complexity of best cases is $O(n\\log_2 n)$ "
